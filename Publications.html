                  <br>
                  Diagnosis and Prediction of cardiovascular diseases has often become a challenge faced by doctors and hospitals in India as well as abroad. Despite major transformations in lifestyles of people and advancements in medical domain; heart attacks still hold a major share in the global death rate.  Various Machine Learning techniques can be used for classifying healthy people from the ones suffering from heart diseases. This work intends to present a comprehensive review of prediction of Cardiac diseases by using Machine Learning based approach.

                  <br>
                  This paper explores the impact of driverless cars in the world of cars.Driverless cars are robotic vehicles designed to operate safely and autonomously without human intervention.This kind of technology has become a concrete reality and may pave the way for future systems where computers take over the art of driving.These cars won’t have a steering wheel,accelarator or a brake pedal because they don’t need them,artificial intelligence softwares and sensors will do all the work.

                  <br>
                  Modern technology has led to many new inventions to cater the growing needs of people. One of the leading inventions is that of mind reading computer. Mind is an abstract entity, which consists of sensations emotions, feelings, desires and intentions. Mind reading is a way to detect or infer person's mental states. The technology is based on the ability to read human mind with use of computers. These computers analyse human brain to detect what it is trying to convey. The paper deals with brief study of major aspects involved in mind reading technology. It provides an effective way to blend human mind and computers.
