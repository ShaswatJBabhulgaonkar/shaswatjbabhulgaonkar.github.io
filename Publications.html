                  This paper explores the impact of driverless cars in the world of cars.Driverless cars are robotic vehicles designed to operate safely and autonomously without human intervention.This kind of technology has become a concrete reality and may pave the way for future systems where computers take over the art of driving.These cars won’t have a steering wheel,accelarator or a brake pedal because they don’t need them,artificial intelligence softwares and sensors will do all the work.

                  <br>
                  Modern technology has led to many new inventions to cater the growing needs of people. One of the leading inventions is that of mind reading computer. Mind is an abstract entity, which consists of sensations emotions, feelings, desires and intentions. Mind reading is a way to detect or infer person's mental states. The technology is based on the ability to read human mind with use of computers. These computers analyse human brain to detect what it is trying to convey. The paper deals with brief study of major aspects involved in mind reading technology. It provides an effective way to blend human mind and computers.
